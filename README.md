# Anagrams-Challenge

Two strings, a and b , are called anagrams if they contain all the same characters in the same frequencies. For this challenge, the test is not case-sensitive. For example, the anagrams of CAT are CAT, ACT, tac, TCA, aTC, and CtA.

isAnagram has the following parameters:
 - string a: the first string
 - string b: the second string

Returns
    boolean: If a and b are case-insensitive anagrams, return true. Otherwise, return false.
